                tansition and have head some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, i've successfuly switched careers,

            <p class="claro">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
                capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need

            <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
            <p class="claro">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure
                from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
